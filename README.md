# Java? Yes JAVA, as in J-A-V-A
## What does it do?
-   There are two main methods.
    -   generate_random_array(int random_limit, int maximum_elements)
    -   um_of_arr(double[] arr)

## License?
> Ha Ha Ha, im gonna license my program which does nothing in significance, how does it sound to you?

What it does is to first generate a random array and then add the sum together. Cool? I think it is, nice for my first OFFICIAL program.

> But why Java?
-   I wanted to learn something new.

> Is it really your first Java program?
-   No, my first program in Java was just a plus machine, adds two numbers together.

> So since you written your first Java program (above), why did you not develop in Java?
-   It was hard as a novice guy to wrap his head around method and some other confusing parts of Java such as void and also method overloading and all this stuff. After getting some programming knowledge by intensively learning Javascript (yes, i know...), I got to understand programming more.

> Nice, what is this for?
-   Nothing, just a milestone in life.
